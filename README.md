# Big O Notation
## Insert sort: 
- Best: O(n)
- Worst: O(n)^2
## Reverse linked list
- Best:O(n)
- Worst: O(n)

# Sorts Descirptions
## Quick Sort
This algorithm picks an element and sorts the remaining elements around it.
## Bubble Sort
This algorithm compares the previous element with the one directly next to it. If the previous one is smaller, it gets shifted one space to the left/
## Insertion sort
This algorithm goes through the list, taking a smaller number and organizing them behind the largest one

# Dijkstra's Algorithm
## It finds the shortest path from one source node to a specific other node. This can be used to find the shortest route between two real world places or finding the most optimal path for an IP router.
